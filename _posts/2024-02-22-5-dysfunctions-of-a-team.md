title:  5 Dysfunctions of a Team
---

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team is a concept from a business book by Patrick Lencioni. The five dysfunctions outlined by Lencioni are as follows:

1. **Absence of Trust**: This occurs when team members are not open with one another and reluctant to be vulnerable within the group. Without trust, collaboration and engagement are compromised.
2. **Fear of Conflict**: A lack of trust leads to a fear of engaging in open, unfiltered debate. Instead of embracing healthy, constructive confrontation, the team avoids conflict, leading to poor decision-making.
3. **Lack of Commitment**: Without having aired their opinions openly in constructive conflict, team members rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions, though they may feign agreement during meetings.
4. **Avoidance of Accountability**: Without committing to a clear plan of action, team members often hesitate to hold one another accountable, which can set low standards and lead to poor performance.
5. **Inattention to Results**: When team members prioritize their individual needs (such as ego, career development, or recognition) or even the needs of their divisions over the collective goals of the team, the team suffers.

Lencioni presents these dysfunctions as part of a model that is hierarchical, meaning that each dysfunction builds upon the previous one. The idea is that addressing these dysfunctions in order can help a team to become more cohesive and effective.
